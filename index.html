        <p class="post-t">Exited about news. I'm finally student. I was sleeping when my cousin Mariam called me on phone. She was happy as hell and I did not have any idea why. She was surprised when i asked him why was she so exited. She answered that i have entered University, specificallyn Business and Technologies University. She's working in Ministry of Education so as soon as she heard about news she called me. I was very sleepy and tired but happiness of such news have overcomed it. It was one of my best days of my life.</p><br>

        <p class="post-t">Almost 1 year since I entered university and best days of my life started. Not gonna lie, my first days werenot as exiting as I expected. My first lecture was math. It was a calculus starting course. I enjoyed doing math tasks but at the same time it was boring as hell. The second lecture was about networks. I was 10 more times exited about that one. But it didnot go the way I expected. Yes, after all, course was interesting and very helpful but the way it started was catastrophic. We were doing some tasks in Cisco packet tracer(Simulation program where we were building up networks and such stuff). I got no idea what lecturer was doing in it and was doing absolutely nothing in my Computer while other students were working hardly. I got very dissapointed and though the whole course will be like that, but, thanks god, it wasnot. Not gonna lie I didnot understand everything in this subject, but at least I understood enough to pass its exams. We will be continuing networks on second course(next semester) and this time I will be more concentrated about it. Next subjects were Basics of Entrepreneurship. Well I won't talk about it much since it didnot taugh me anything. The only part of this subject I enjoyed was the teamwork. I worked with my team and we were doing a great work together on our imaginary start-up. Basics of digital technology: well pretty much same as last one. We were studing basic IT stuff. Operational systems, popular softwares for working with images videos, some file types and other things which I already knew. But the next one was worst subject of whole course so far. Subject was called mobile developement. Subject itself is interesting because it was teaching us basics of Mobile developement languages such as kotlin and Java. But half of the semester was gone for nothing because of lecturer. He was teaching terribly. His lectures was like first grader being told the 5th grade stuff. After half semester he was fired because too many students complainted about him. Other lecturer which replaced him was 10 times better than him. but problem was that I still didnot know anything about subject and this problem was getting bigger and bigger. bad start resulted in not doing any homework and not getting enough points to go on final exam. Thanks to my lecturer he understanted my problem and gave me chance. But I still failed the exam because I couldnot answer any questions. Still I had chance to close out subject with second repetitive exam. It was first time I seriously started working on subject. Worst part was that program where the mobile projects are written is hard to work with. I didnot sleep 2 nights straight because I was doing exam project and finally I passed it. The last subject of semester was basics of Python, programming language. This subject was my favorite one. At first I was lazy to study it and I almost failed first intermediate exam because of it. This was the moment when I started studying this subject seriously and some days later I could write hard logics/scripts in it. The best part of it was that I was enjoying doing that and I continued working on it even after semester ended. We were studying it in second semester as well and this was even more productive. Lecturer was the best. She taugh us subject in easiest ways and in the end of semester I got 100 points overall, highest of points first time in university. I got more interested in subject and I'm studying it even now. I think that I finally found my future proffession and will work hard for it. One more subject I want to talk about is basics of databases. This one was also interesting. Lecturer was teaching us in very interesting ways: His way of speaking was the best, he was giving real life examples of importance of subject and other. There were other subjects as well: Math 2, Architecture of Personal Computer, Basics of Management, Start-ups. But theres not much I can tell about these ones because they didnot interest me much. That's my first year of life as student.</p><br>

        <p class="post-t">Not a long time ago, I started studying Front-end developement. I havenot started it in university yet, but I have several reasons to already start working on it. <br>
        First of all I'm doing it because of Python. 1 month ago I started learning one of Python's most used modules named Flask. It's framework for working on websites. It's very important for a back-end developer to know at least 1 back-end language, so I started with Flask. but after learning some things in it, I realised that working with html files is important part of Flask. And since I didnot know much about html I stopped learning Flask and started learning the whole Front-end developement. Well it's not important for back-end developer to fully develope front-end skills but I decided to anyway work hard on it, because I don't want to have any problem while learning Flask. And there am I now. I found one websites where is free courses not only on html/css but other subjects aswell. So after I end this course I'm planning to start learning other ones. because the way this webpage is teaching subjects is very interesting.<br> 
        Second reason why I want to learn Front-end is because I want to have skills of designing webpages too. I might have my own webpage later so it's useful skill to have.<br>
        Third reason why I want to learn Front-end is because the fourth semester I will be learning it in university. So anyway I will have to learn it. so why not start learning it now?
